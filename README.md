Crop Yield prediction System
The sysem was trained using data gotten from Kaggle, uploaded to Google colab, cleaned, preprocessed. 
The algorithm used for the prediction was Random forest because of it's cpabilities of understanding complex relationship in a dataset. 
The data was split 80 (for training) to 20 (for testing). 
Training began after all th conditions o trin hasbeen met, i.e every feature that is imporant has been added and the one we want to predict has been dropped. 
After the training, we got the following result on the regression model: 

Mean Absolute Error: 0.531987891759175
RÂ² Score: 0.7534891712490033
Mean Squared Error: 0.3839535595848623
Root Mean Squared Error: 0.6196398628113449
Explained Variance Score: 0.7540257944552557
